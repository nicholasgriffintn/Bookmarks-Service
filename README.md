# Serverless GraphQL Bookmarks Service

This is a Serverless service that will process the bookmark emails from my Inbox Service (https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/Serverless-Email-Inbox) and store that processed data within DynamoDB.

Alongside that, this service also offers up a GraphQL API that will allow me to retrieve the processed data from my personal site for displaying within the page.

I will also hook up mutations so that Bookmarks can be verified from my Cognito user's account.

You can find the full details for this service here:
